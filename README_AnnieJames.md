# Annie James – EdTech Operations Platform

**Annie James** is a role-based EdTech operations platform that unifies courses, batches, assessments, payments, announcements, feedback, attendance, and exports into a **policy-driven, audit-ready system**.  
The case study highlights problem framing, PRD development, RBAC design, analytics strategy, and experiments that reduce operational overhead and improve learner clarity.

##  Supporting Material  
All screenshots, workflow images, and demo files (if any) can be added to your repo’s `/assets` folder.

##  Overview
Institutions often operate using disconnected tools—Drive, Sheets, Forms, WhatsApp, Razorpay—leading to confusion, errors, and inconsistent policy enforcement.  
**Annie James centralizes every operation** into one governed, trackable platform.
